# "Finding the right way to code"

## Work_CodingStandard

This is my `Coding Standard` for fast and concise code writing.

## ToDo in this project

1. Python scripts for generating templates, like generating .h/.c for different modules (eg. task_xxx.c/.h, dev_xxx.c/.h, bsp_xxx.c/.h).
2. Python scripts for generating project directory structure.
